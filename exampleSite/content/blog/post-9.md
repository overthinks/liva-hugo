# The burden of disciplining your thoughts

Not able to focus? Making repeated mistakes, bad decisions, and feeling lazy?- Learn how to discipline your thoughts and all your worries should start going away one by one. 

<hr>

### We are always running in the Rat Race.

Thoughts lead to actions. Our thoughts are our own but also influenced by intent, people, the environment, and others' sentiments. Our minds always try to fit into the environment and people around us. Developing your way of dealing with problems and not getting influenced is required. But we tend to grow habits and methods with lesser efficiency.

#### Hardships, Experiences, and your Wisdom is telling you something, are you listening?

When we have lived our 20s, we have already faced our share of hardships, struggled to reach somewhere, gained something, and lost some things too. The wisdom and experience in us have grown. So, what are these three words trying to tell you from the beginning - 'Discipline your thoughts and actions. But you must be thinking - "Easier said than done."

### Disciplining your thoughts

You can always start small, continue the daily efforts and sum it up to take a giant step one day and then keep repeating the whole process. The same is valid for installing discipline in your thoughts.

> **_Try to find flow in everything you do._**

Focus on a single task at a time - start it, and realize distracting thoughts. Next, remove or postpone them, resume and enjoy the process, and finally complete it. It may not make sense to you but try doing it three to four times every twenty-four hours. Later, you may find fruit in your action and love completing tasks more often. You can set timers and finish them in a set time. Also, if you need to take a short break after completing - "Do so!". Then resume another task. This reference is from "the Pomodoro Technique" - the popular time management method. You can google it and read more about it to gain better clarity.

> Create dignity and value for the task at hand

Suppose you were to study for an upcoming exam - you will procrastinate and kill time with leisure activities. You'll tell your mind, "I will study later as there is still time." When you are ready to study, some thoughts are still disturbing you and other inanimate objects like your gadgets, smartphone, comfy room, and feeling of laziness.

##### Now, what to do?

Pay attention to the next set of steps, start following them and eliminate unnecessary evil:

1. Keep your phone silent and away from you. Think of activating the Zen Mode - which locks your phone for a set number of minutes/hrs
2. Ask yourself, "What am I losing in the moment? Should I study or not?"
3. Next, add these questions and ask yourself, "If I don't study, will I regret it or not? This time and opportunity won't come again. I have to focus and remove everything else from my mind. Create that boundary in your mind. It should be between the task at hand and unrequired thoughts. Finally, get back to work.
4. Take a deep breath and tell yourself, "I will study for these minutes. I will enjoy the process and try to learn something new."
5. Once your rhythm sets, nothing will bother you. Taking breaks in between is ok.
6. When you start accomplishing small goals, you will look for bigger ones and grab them. Always try to find purpose and motivation in doing something and you won't lose your way.

To summarise, you created value for studying by asking those questions to yourself. Next, you gained dignity as you removed distractions. You calmed your mind and got serious about it. Lastly, you pushed yourself and started studying. The intent became clear.

### Why do you feel burdened before even starting it?

* You have imagined a scenario that froze you or made you feel stressed or tensed
* You get an unsure or unmotivated feeling to pursue it
* You are puzzled and feel jinxed at the moment
* You made this task more of a mess in your head before the start

These could be the possible reasons. Don't stress over it. Ask yourself, "If I overthink or stress about it, is anything going to change or affect the outcome without my actions ?". You know the correct answer is "NO" here. Do it. You will understand why or why not to continue. Your doubts will fade away sooner than you thought

### Escaping the burden and Creating a pattern that is upgradeable

To escape the burden of disciplining your thoughts, you need to tell yourself, "I wish for growth. I have to explore new ways every day." You will create modes of discipline in your mind about the exact, similar repetitive tasks. You will discover a pattern of doing things a particular way and can upgrade its efficiency. For example, "You code a problem in 60 mins by practicing daily. Eventually, you notice what is taking your time. It was the repeated lines of coding and extra tasks. You found a way to deal with it in 50 mins and finally in 40 mins. You completed it more efficiently in a reduced time. This pattern will always have room for improvement. It can grow and change as you learn more. Hence we can say it is upgradeable.
